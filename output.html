figures are kept with the text that discusses them. In print, this means they
are not relegated to a separate page. On the web, that means readability of
graphics and their accompanying text without extra clicks, tab-switching, or
scrolling.</p><p>Figures should try to use the <code>figure</code> element, which by default are constrained
to the main column. Donâ€™t wrap figures in a paragraph tag. Any label or margin
note goes in a regular margin note inside the figure. For example, most of the
time one should introduce a figure directly into the main flow of discussion,
like so:</p><figure><label for="md-HklUszmef" class="margin-toggle ">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="md-HklUszmef" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote">From Edward Tufte, <em>Visual Display of Quantitative Information</em>, page 92.</span>
