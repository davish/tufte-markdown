One of the most distinctive features of Tufte's style is his extensive use of
sidenotes.[^3] Sidenotes are like footnotes, except they don't force the reader
to jump their eye to the bottom of the page, but instead display off to the side
in the margin. Perhaps you have noticed their use in this document already. You
are very astute.

  This is a sidenote.


<span class="newthought">In his later books</span>[^1], Tufte starts each
section with a bit of vertical space, a non-indented paragraph, and the first
few words of the sentence set in small caps. For this we use a span with the
class `newthought`, as demonstrated at the beginning of this paragraph. Vertical
spacing is accomplished separately through `<section>` tags. Be consistent:
though we do so in this paragraph for the purpose of demonstration, do not
alternate use of header elements and the `newthought` technique. Pick one
approach and stick to it.
